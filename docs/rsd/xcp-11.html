Abstract

    This document describes the XCloud Protocol, how it should work and what
    a server & client should reply depending on the input. Communication between
    both parties is split into packets, which are easier to handle. They still
    are sent over the TCP/IP network stack, but with custom application-level
    packets.

    The standard shown in this document defines the XCP version 1.


1. Packet

    The smallest unit of communication in this protocol is a packet. All data
    is split into packets for easier handling and control. Each packet has the
    same packet header, containing the type, version, userid & payloda size.

        +------+------+-------------------------------------------------+
        | offt | size | contains                                        |
        +------+------+-------------------------------------------------+
        |    0 |    1 | type of the packet                              |
        |    1 |    1 | version of the protocol                         |
        |    2 |    2 | size of the payload in bytes                    |
        |    4 |    8 | user ID, required for some transactions         |
        |   12 |  ... | packet payload starts here                      |
        +------+------+-------------------------------------------------+

2. User ID

    Each device is assigned a unique user ID, which the device then needs to store
    to send files & messages later on. Each new client, in order to acquire such
    ID should send a XCP_NEW packet to the server, requesting a new ID along with
    passing a sufficient username to be used.

    Each user ID is exactly 8 bytes, with each byte meaning a specific thing.

        +------+------+-------------------------------------------------+
        | offt | size | contains                                        |
        +------+------+-------------------------------------------------+
        |    0 |    1 | magic byte, 0x88 for a valid user ID            |
        |    1 |    3 | last 3 bytes of the time of creation            |
        |    4 |    4 | random bytes                                    |
        +------+------+-------------------------------------------------+
