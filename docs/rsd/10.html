Abstract

    This document describes the syntax and rules of the buildfile, which is used
    by the build tool for compiling programs &amp; running custom scripts from it.
    All implementations using the buildfile format _must_ adhere to this file
    specification, but they may implement their own additions. This means that
    a buildfile created using this document will work for every tool, but when
    created for a specific tool, it may not work on every tool.


1. Syntax

    The buildfile is parsed based on newlines, so each line represents something
    different. There are only 4 valid line types in the buildfile (the vertical
    bars represent the start &amp; end of a line):

    (a) Empty line
        Any line that begins with a whitespace character. Any character after
        may not be parsed.

    (b) Comment
        Any line that begins with a hash (#) and does not contain any whitespace
        characters before that is a comment and should be skipped by the parser.

            # This is a comment

    (c) Option
        Any line that contains atleast a single word, also known as the keyword,
        (^\w+.*$) is an option. Any characters atleast 1 whitespace character
        after the keyword are the whitespace-seperated arguments.

            option arg1 arg2

    (d) Target
        Any line that begins with an at-sign (@) and does not contain any
        whitespace character before that is a target. The target name must be
        placed right after the at-sign, without any whitespace in between. The
        shell command is placed atleast one whitespace character after the
        target name.

            @target_name   sh-command

        Some parsers may offer the ability to quote the target name, allowing
        for whitespace characters in it. This is not required.


2. Lines

    Newlines may be escaped using a back-slash (\). No whitespace can
    be found after the back-slash, only the newline byte (0x0a).

                         v no whitespace here
        src     *.c     \
                !test.c

    If there are no spaces between the back-slash and other arguments, the
    parser should still count the newline as a whitespace seperating arguments.
    (a) The parser must provide a minimum line length of 4095 chars.

        #define MIN_LINE    4095

        char linebuf[MIN_LINE+1];

    In this example the buffer has enough space for a single line and the null
    byte to end the C-string.


3. Options

    Because the buildfile syntax may be used in different tools apart from the
    actual build tool, no standard options are provided, all tools can implement
    their own.


4. Targets

    The shell command provided in the target should be ran in an enviroment
    supporting (a) atleast a POSIX shell, usually offered by system() in C
    (when on a Unix system).

    Because targets are designed to be called from the command line, (b) a tool
    must offer atleast one way of calling each defined target. There are three
    targets that have special functionality. Only if they can be found in the
    buildfile, the three targets:

    (c) @default
        Calling the tool without specifying any target will select this target.
        If the tool should continue after this target is run is implementation
        defined.

    (d) @before
        Is ran before anything else happens.

    (e) @after
        Is ran after everything has happened.
