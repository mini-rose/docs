Reference Specification Documents
=================================

Copyright (C) 2022 bellrise <bellrise.dev@gmail.com>

This is the list of all current Reference Specification Documents (RSDs).
All my tools & code follow these specifications (when defined), in order
to achieve a proper level of standardization. Apart from just rules, these
documents show real-life examples to make them easier to understand.

In order to reference a rule or specification in code, you may provide
a comment above the code section:

    /* RSD 10/2a: provide atleast a 4095 char line buffer */
